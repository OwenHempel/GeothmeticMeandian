## Picking a Good Average Can Be Notoriously Difficult.

Given a set of data, Picking a single point as a representative of the set can be a difficult proposition. As proposed by XKCD, simply calculating them all a bunch of times may be a very good alternative. 

Seeing as I had encountered this problem twice in my career, I decided that it would be most efficient to spend several hours creating a permanent solution.

## Enter the Python Package: Gmdn

It's not like I have an urgent lack of things to do, this was simply the most important task in the universe.

The package is built to be flexible, accepting any type of iterable, provided it contains only ints or floats. It's not particularly fast, but quite suitable for small-to-medium datasets.
